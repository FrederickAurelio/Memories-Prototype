# Memories Photo Frame Prototype

<p>First time learning using HTML5 Canvas in React</p>
<p>Soon it will become a proper web application with current tech stacks like Nextjs, Expressjs, Typescript, and more, with a tons of feature like current social media for example Instagram</p>
In here I don't manually do it from scratch. I'm using one of React Library called Konva
https://konvajs.org/docs/react/Intro.html

# Features
- Snap: Automatically snap to the clippers (Here I use a complex calculation to do it)
- Rope: Able to create rope by click and drag
- Transform: Able to resize, rotate the image and drag it to another place
- The Image can't be dragged outside the frame (Calculate the frame size and image size and rotation degree)
